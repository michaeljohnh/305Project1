How to add uberEATS functionality

The program can have uberEATS functionality by modifying extending the Entity class
to a uberEATSClient class.

This way, the original location of the UberEATS client will be the restaurant where the Driver will pick up the food.
The destination of the UberEATS client will be the home/office of the UberEATS client.
The fare will be much higher as the cost of food will be factored in the fare.
